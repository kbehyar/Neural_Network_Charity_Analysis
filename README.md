# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

This project is looking at creating a neural network model which will help by predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. 

## Results

### Data Preprocessing


Data Preprocessing
- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?

The target variable is the "IS_SUCCESSFUL" column

- What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?

The features variables are the "APPLICATION_TYPE", "AFFILIATION", "CLASSIFICATION", "USE_CASE", "ORGANIZATION", "INCOME_AMT", "SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS", "ASK_AMT" columns

- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

The variable that are not considered targets or features are the "EIN","NAME" columns

## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?



- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?



- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
